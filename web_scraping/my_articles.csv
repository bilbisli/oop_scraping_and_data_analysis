2022-09-18T04:02:36.000Z,Joe Biden arrives in London for Queen's funeral,"US President Joe Biden has arrived in London ahead of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday.
Mr Biden is among some 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries coming to London for a gathering of world leaders not seen for decades.
The prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand are already in the UK.
Controversy surrounds some of the guests invited, such as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
As well as Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, other Commonwealth leaders expected to attend include Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe. India will be represented by President Droupadi Murmu.
French President Emmanuel Macron, Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Italian President Sergio Mattarella are among the other world leaders expected to attend.
Members of royal families from across Europe will also be present.
Many of the guests are expected to pay their respects to the Queen at her lying-in-state in Westminster Hall and sign a book of condolence at Lancaster House.
But the focus will be a formal state reception hosted by King Charles III at Buckingham Palace on Sunday.
For many leaders, it will be their only chance to meet collectively and engage in some diplomacy.
Some of the guests invited to attend the funeral have, however, raised eyebrows.
The extension of an invite to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammed Bin Salman (known as MBS) has proved controversial.
He is accused of ordering the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018 - an accusation the Crown Prince and his government deny.
The fianc√©e of Mr Khashoggi, Hatice Gengiz, said he should not be allowed to attend the event and that it was a stain on the memory of the Queen.
Another invite which has led to criticism is that for China's President Xi Jinping, due to accusations of crimes against humanity levelled at the Chinese government.
But it will not be President Xi attending the funeral. Instead, Vice President Wang Qishan will travel to the UK.
Representatives from Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Afghanistan have not been invited.
Iran, North Korea (DPRK) and Nicaragua have only been invited to send ambassadors, rather than heads of state.

2022-09-17T19:17:34+00:00,Tottenham Hotspur 6-2 Leicester City: Son Heung-min ends barren start with 13-minute hat-trick,"Son Heung-min ended his goal drought with a scintillating 13-minute hat-trick as Tottenham ruthlessly punished Leicester's latest defensive horror show.
The South Korea striker responded to Antonio Conte's decision to drop him to the bench after a barren start to the season by coming on to curl home two fantastic strikes and slot home a late third.
Spurs trailed to Youri Tielemans' early penalty but took advantage of the Foxes' failings at set-pieces as Harry Kane and Eric Dier nodded home from corners to turn the game around.
James Maddison's fabulous first-time finish briefly drew Leicester level again, but Wilfried Ndidi's mistake allowed Rodrigo Bentancur to steer Tottenham back in front before substitute Son stole the show.
Victory maintained Spurs' unbeaten start to the Premier League season as they climbed to second, level on points with leaders Manchester City.
Leicester, meanwhile, remain at the foot of the table, still searching for their first win, despite having led in four of their seven matches thus far.
As at all Premier League games this weekend, fans observed a minute's silence for the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and a 70th-minute round of applause in honour of her 70-year reign.
Son had failed to score in eight games in all competitions for Spurs so far this season but it was still a brave decision from boss Conte to drop last season's joint-Golden Boot winner.
In fairness, he could not have asked for better opposition to open his account, given the brittleness of the Foxes' backline but the quality of his first two strikes stood out.
Both were curled into the top corner from the edge of the box - the first with his right foot, the second with his left - as the 30-year-old proved the old adage that form is temporary but class permanent.
Even an erroneous offside flag could not deny him the match ball as VAR replays showed he was just onside when he strode clear to beat Danny Ward for his third goal and Spurs' sixth.
While Son's stunning cameo will hog the headlines, there was plenty more for Conte to be pleased about after seeing his side record a seventh successive win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
Five different players provided assists, with Ivan Perisic's dead-ball delivery complementing Dejan Kulusevski's crosses from open play, while Bentancur contributed his first goal for the club.
But they will need to cut out defensive lapses such as Davinson Sanchez's needless challenge on James Justin that handed Leicester their early lead, Tielemans tucking home at the second attempt after VAR spotted Hugo Lloris had encroached off his line in saving the initial spot-kick.
When it comes to defensive debacles, however, no top-flight team is a patch on Leicester, who have now lost 4-2, 5-2 and 6-2 on the road this season, conceding a league-high 22 goals overall.
It is not a new phenomenon either - they have kept just two clean sheets in 19 games, conceded 25 set-piece goals since the start of last season and dropped 11 points from winning positions this term alone.
While boss Brendan Rodgers, enduring the longest losing league run of his career after six successive defeats, said earlier this week the club's hierarchy had been ""very supportive"", that patience surely has a limit after a haul of just one point from seven games.
The dithering Ndidi's error to help Bentancur put Spurs 3-2 up at a vital juncture of the game characterised their lack of confidence, while deadline-day signing Wout Faes endured a chastening debut.
Until Son's introduction and Leicester's collapse, the Foxes arguably created as many chances as the hosts in the first hour, with Lloris notably saving well from Maddison and Patson Daka with the game in the balance.
But the Foxes' talented attackers, even the again excellent Maddison, who brilliantly swept home Timothy Castagne's cross to make it 2-2, simply cannot cancel out the volume of goals shipped at the other end.
It could have been more too. A Daka own goal was ruled out for a foul by Sanchez on Ward, who also tipped a header from the Spurs defender onto the bar later in the first half.

2022-09-17T23:11:30.000Z,Ukraine war: Power back on at huge nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia,"The UN's nuclear watchdog (IAEA) says Ukraine's huge Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has begun receiving power from the national grid once again.
Shelling in the area damaged power lines connected to the plant.
All six of its reactors are in a state of cold shutdown, but the plant needs external power to cool its reactors and defend against the risk of a meltdown.
The IAEA says the situation of the plant, which is held by Russian forces, has improved but remains precarious.
A team of nuclear experts from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) travelled to Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear plant, at the beginning of the month.
The trip followed increasing calls from Ukraine and the international community for a safety inspection following reports of shelling.
Russia and Ukraine both blamed each other for the shelling of the facility in south-east Ukraine.
After the IAEA's first inspection, the agency announced it would maintain a permanent presence in order to monitor the situation.
Members of the team at the site on Saturday learnt that one of the four main external power lines damaged by shelling had been repaired, allowing electricity to be received directly from the national grid, the IAEA tweeted on Saturday.
Further east in Ukraine, the discovery of mass graves in Izyum has led the European Union presidency to call for an international tribunal for war crimes to be carried out.
Hundreds of bodies have been discovered buried in a forest at the edge of the city, which recently came under the control of Ukraine after Russian forces retreated.
Many are said to be civilians, women and children among them.
Ukraine says it believes war crimes have been committed.
""In the 21st Century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,"" said Jan Lipavsky, foreign minister of the Czech Republic which holds the EU's rotating presidency.
""We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.""
Fighting raged on Saturday in the divided eastern region of Donetsk, which is mostly under the control of Russian-backed separatists.
The separatist mayor of Donetsk city said four people had been killed by Ukrainian government shelling of a central district while the Donetsk region's Ukrainian governor accused Russian forces of shelling a thermal power plant in Mykolaivka, disrupting drinking water supplies in the area.
Ukrainian troops are continuing their counter-offensive in the country's north-east, after successfully recapturing territory from Russia in recent days, the UK's defence ministry says. It adds that Russia has established a defensive line protecting one of its main supply routes from Belgorod, near its border with Ukraine.

Alain Robert climbed the Tour TotalEnergies in the D√©fense business district using no ropes or harness.

""I promised myself several years ago that when I would reach 60, I would climb that tower again because 60 symbolises retirement age in France and I thought that was a nice touch,"" he said after the climb.
He added that the aim of the climb was also to raise awareness of global warming, according to Reuters.

2022-09-17T18:08:57+00:00,Jack Grealish answers critics in Wolves win as 'ominous' Man City roll on,"Jack Grealish could not have asked for a better response to his growing band of critics.
After having both his performances for Manchester City and his place in the England squad called into question, Grealish responded with his first goal of the season, after just 55 seconds, against Wolves on Saturday.
The forward was also at the centre of most of the visitors' attacking play as he helped Pep Guardiola's men cruise to a 3-0 victory.
The result sees City head into the international break on top of the table after scoring 23 times in seven Premier League matches, while in Erling Haaland they have a striker in red-hot form with 14 goals in nine games in all competitions.
The campaign is not yet one fifth of the way through, but already questions are being asked about how anyone can stop City becoming only the fifth English club - after Huddersfield, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United - to win three league titles in a row.
""It feels ominous for everyone, and almost feels like a one-horse race whatever the table tells you,"" former England defender Rio Ferdinand told BT Sport.
""People have started to question Jack Grealish, today he answered the critics in a wonderful way.""
Guardiola knows Grealish's British record ¬£100m transfer from Aston Villa brings added pressure, yet has unconditional trust in him to deliver.
Not much attention was paid to Grealish's slightly disappointing contribution to City's title-winning campaign last season, but there is more focus this time around.
Guardiola went out of his way to talk up the 26-year-old before the Wolves game, saying he was ""delighted with his behaviour and everything"" even though City's Champions League comeback against Borussia Dortmund in midweek came after Grealish had left the field.
The manager kept faith with Grealish and if it is regarded as a positive when opposition fans start to target you, the forward should be quite happy with his performance against at Molineux.
A combination of his Villa connection, scoring inside a minute and being on the end of Nathan Collins' red-card challenge meant Grealish was singled out by the Wolves faithful throughout.
He responded with understated, yet pointed, applause towards the South Bank when he was replaced by Cole Palmer 13 minutes from time, before thanking Guardiola for his support.
""It is nice when Pep defends me,"" he said. ""I probably have to thank him because he gave me the opportunity today after my performance on Wednesday, which probably wasn't the best.""
Guardiola, meanwhile, just wants Grealish to be the player that persuaded him to pay big money to Villa last year.
""They don't have to say thank you,"" he said. ""I have confidence in all of them. I trust them unconditionally.
""Everybody has good moments and bad moments. The important thing is he thinks, 'I am Jack Grealish, I play like I am'. That is all I want for him.""
Haaland has never scored in eight successive games. A goal against Manchester United next time out would see the 22-year-old reach that milestone.
It has almost reached the point where it would be a shock if Haaland failed to find the net, so unerring has been his finishing.
His latest effort was a rarity in that it was struck from outside the box - and one senses Guardiola will have been just as pleased with the Norwegian's contribution for City's third, which saw him have the awareness to roll the ball to Kevin de Bruyne, who crossed for Phil Foden to convert.
Haaland now has 11 goals in seven league games. In the season that Mo Salah scored 34 to break the Premier League record for a 38-game campaign, he had reached four at the same point.
Only Fulham's Aleksander Mitrovic has reached half Haaland's tally so far this season.
Even though Haaland will be absent later this year from the World Cup, which starts after the 2022 Ballon d'Or is awarded, former Manchester United defender Ferdinand can only see one winner next year if the Norwegian's form ultimately powers City to Champions League glory next June.
""He has the ability to break records because he is playing in a team that is absolutely dominating,"" Ferdinand said.
""If Man City win the Champions League, there is no question he will win the Ballon d'Or. He is head and shoulders above anyone else.""",Simon Stone,BBC Sport at Molineux,Manchester City beat Wolves 3-0 in their Premier League clash on Saturday.

2022-09-17T18:03:23+00:00,Newcastle United 1-1 Bournemouth: Alexander Isak cancels out Philip Billing opener,"Alexander Isak scored his first goal at St James' Park but Newcastle remain without a win since the opening day of the Premier League season after being held by a disciplined Bournemouth.
Eddie Howe's side fell behind against his former club when midfielder Philip Billing stretched to steer a Jordan Zemura cross from the left-hand wing past Nick Pope with just over an hour gone.
Five minutes later Newcastle were level as Isak - a club record ¬£60m summer signing from Real Sociedad - converted a penalty after Jefferson Lerma was adjudged to have handled a Kieran Trippier cross by the video assistant referee.
The draw is Newcastle's fifth of the season and stretches their winless run to six games, although they climb to 10th in the table.
Bournemouth have now claimed five points from an available nine under caretaker manager Gary O'Neil to leave them 12th.
As at all Premier League games this weekend there was a minute's silence before kick-off, which was impeccably observed, for the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II followed by the national anthem. There was also stadium-wide applause in the 70th minute in honour of her 70-year reign.
It has been a frustrating start to the season for Newcastle with goals hard to come by, and this will be another game where they will feel they should have taken three points.
They were dominant for large periods - they had 72% possession and 20 attempts at goal - but again lacked a clinical edge.
They had chances with a Trippier free-kick and a cushioned Joelinton effort both striking posts in the first half.
Bournemouth's summer signing Neto also tipped away efforts from Joelinton and Ryan Fraser, but the latter, who earned a recall to the Scotland squad this week, and Miguel Almiron spurned good opportunities.
It left Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley looking unimpressed in the stands, with the results this season not yet matching Newcastle's lofty ambitions.
Howe was similarly frustrated, telling BBC Sport: ""I don't think we played particularly well, we were off our best level. One for us to reflect on.
""I am desperate to win, it feels like a long time for us. We need to win and compete and be the best versions of us.""
A period of change may be forthcoming at Bournemouth too, with a Las Vegas consortium hoping to buy the club.
It has left uncertainty about the manager's role with O'Neil now in charge since Scott Parker was sacked on 30 August, but it has hard to argue with the results that the former Portsmouth and Middlesbrough midfielder has produced.
Bournemouth looked organised and were prepared to put their bodies on the line, while on another day they could have taken three points as Marcus Tavernier headed wide in the first period before driving wide in the second.
Whether O'Neil will be in charge when Bournemouth host Brentford on 1 October - the next round of Premier League fixtures after the international break - remains to be seen.
""I will be finding out what's happening club-wise next week and will see what the plan is,"" O'Neil told BBC Sport.
""I have no idea what's happening - I knew I was taking today and I don't know about further, I guess I'll find out tomorrow.""

2022-09-17T05:48:49.000Z,IHG hack: 'Vindictive' couple deleted hotel chain data for fun,"Hackers have told the BBC they carried out a destructive cyber-attack against Holiday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) ""for fun"".
Describing themselves as a couple from Vietnam, they say they first tried a ransomware attack, then deleted large amounts of data when they were foiled.
They accessed the FTSE 100 firm's databases thanks to an easily found and weak password, Qwerty1234.
An expert says the case highlights the vindictive side of criminal hackers.
UK-based IHG operates 6,000 hotels around the world, including the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent brands.
On Monday last week, customers reported widespread problems with booking and check-in.
For 24 hours IHG responded to complaints on social media by saying that the company was ""undergoing system maintenance"".
Then on the Tuesday afternoon it told investors that it had been hacked.
""Booking channels and other applications have been significantly disrupted since yesterday,"" it said in an official notice lodged with the London Stock Exchange.
The hackers, calling themselves TeaPea, contacted the BBC on the encrypted messaging app, Telegram, providing screenshots as evidence that they had carried out the hack.
The images, which IHG has confirmed are genuine, show they gained access to the company's internal Outlook emails, Microsoft Teams chats and server directories.
""Our attack was originally planned to be a ransomware but the company's IT team kept isolating servers before we had a chance to deploy it, so we thought to have some funny [sic]. We did a wiper attack instead,"" one of the hackers said.
A wiper attack is a form of cyber-attack that irreversibly destroys data, documents and files.
Cyber-security specialist Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security at Forescout, said the incident was a cautionary tale as, even though the company's IT team initially found a way to fend them off, the hackers were still able to find a way to inflict damage.
""The hackers' change of tactic seems born out of vindictive frustration,"" he said. ""They couldn't make money so they lashed out, and that absolutely betrays the fact that we are not talking about 'professional' cybercriminals here.""
IHG says customer-facing systems are returning to normal but that services may remain intermittent.
The hackers are showing no remorse about the disruption they have caused the company and its customers.
""We don't feel guilty, really. We prefer to have a legal job here in Vietnam but the wage is average $300 per month. I'm sure our hack won't hurt the company a lot.""
The hackers say no customer data was stolen but they do have some corporate data, including email records.
TeaPea say they gained access to IHG's internal IT network by tricking an employee into downloading a malicious piece of software through a booby-trapped email attachment.
They also had to bypass an additional security prompt message sent to the worker's devices as part of a two-factor authentication system.
The criminals then say they accessed the most sensitive parts of IHG's computer system after finding login details for the company's internal password vault.
""The username and password to the vault was available to all employees, so 200,000 staff could see. And the password was extremely weak,"" they told the BBC.
Surprisingly, the password was Qwerty1234, which regularly appears on lists of most commonly used passwords worldwide.
""Sensitive data should only be available to employees who need access to that data to do their job, and they should have the minimum level of access [needed] to use that data,"" said Mr Ferguson, after seeing the screenshots.
""Even a highly complex password is just as insecure as a simple one if it is left exposed.""
An IHG spokeswoman disputed that the password vault details were not secure, saying that the attacker had to evade ""multiple layers of security"", but would not give details about the extra security.
""IHG employs a defence-in-depth strategy to information security that leverages many modern security solutions,"" she added.",Joe Tidy,Cyber reporter,"Hackers say they carried out a destructive cyber-attack against Holiday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotels Group.

2022-09-16T11:33:39.000Z,"Chrissy Teigen says she has come to realise she had an abortion, not a miscarriage","Chrissy Teigen has spoken about how she has come to realise the loss of her baby during pregnancy two years ago was an abortion rather than a miscarriage.
The US model revealed in 2020 that she had lost a baby at 20 weeks, as a result of a pregnancy complication.
At the time, the loss was described as a miscarriage, and she shared emotional photos from her hospital bedside.
She now says she had to make ""difficult and heartbreaking"" decisions after learning the child would not survive.
""It became very clear around halfway through that he would not survive, and that I wouldn't either without any medical intervention,"" Teigen explained.
She said she had only recently come to accept the procedure as ""an abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance"".
Teigen, who is married to singer John Legend, was speaking at a conference session in the wake of the US Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn the Roe vs Wade ruling, which has allowed states to block abortion access.
The TV personality said she had discussed the ruling with Legend, and expressed sympathy with people who have to make a decision to have an abortion, when her husband made her realise that she had in fact been one of those people.
""I fell silent, feeling weird that I hadn't made sense of it that way,"" Teigen told the A Day of Unreasonable Conversation summit, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.
""I told the world we had a miscarriage, the world agreed we had a miscarriage, all the headlines said it was a miscarriage.
""And I became really frustrated that I didn't, in the first place, say what it was, and I felt silly that it had taken me over a year to actually understand that we had had an abortion.""
The couple had already named the unborn child Jack, the 36-year-old explained.
""Two years ago, when I was pregnant with Jack - John and my third child - I had to make a lot of difficult and heartbreaking decisions,"" she said.
She told the session about having a miscarriage, before stopping herself and saying: ""Let's just call it what it was. It was an abortion. An abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance. And to be honest, I never, ever put that together until, actually, a few months ago.""
Several weeks after losing her baby, Teigen wrote a moving blog explaining that she had been induced to deliver Jack at 20 weeks after being diagnosed with partial placental abruption.
Placental abruption is when the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall.
She recounted how her bleeding had become heavier and she went into hospital, where doctors ""tried bags and bags of blood transfusions"", but they had no effect.
""After a couple nights at the hospital, my doctor told me exactly what I knew was coming - it was time to say goodbye,"" she wrote.

2022-09-07T23:06:01.000Z,Should billboard advertising be banned?,"Campaigner Charlotte Gage says that the outdoor adverts you see on billboards and bus stops should all be removed.
""These ads are in the public space without any consultation about what is shown on them,"" she says. ""Plus they cause light pollution, and the ads are for things people can't afford, or don't need.""
Ms Gage is the network director of UK pressure group Adfree Cities, which wants a complete ban on all outdoor corporate advertising. This would also apply to the sides of buses, and on the London Underground and other rail and metro systems.
If you think this is a fanciful aim, then you might need to think again, as it has already happened in a few places around the world.
As far back as 2006, the giant Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, the largest in the southern hemisphere, banned all forms of outdoor advertising. Under the so-called Clean City Law, more than 15,000 billboards were subsequently removed, plus 300,000 store signs that were considered to be too large.
The French city of Grenoble followed suit in 2014. Its Assistant Mayor Lucile Lheureux explained at the time that the advertising firms wanted to upgrade their billboards to digital screens and ""we don't want our city's children bombarded with animated advertising on TV screens in the street"".
More recently, Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, banned some outdoor adverts last year - those for petrol and diesel-fuelled cars and air travel.
And this March, Bristol City Council banned outdoor adverts for gambling firms, junk food, alcohol and payday loans, but only on the advertising spaces that it owns, including bus shelters and billboards. Norwich City Council is exploring a similar move after councillors last year voted in favour.
Ms Gage says that while there are ""ethical issues with junk food ads, pay day loans and high-carbon products [in particular], people would rather see community ads and art rather than have multi-billion dollar companies putting logos and images everywhere"".
She adds: ""We're not saying people shouldn't own cars or eat burgers, but we know there's a direct correlation between seeing ads and purchasing these products.""
Ms Gage adds that resistance to such ""sight pollution"" is growing in the UK. Adfree Cities, which was set up in 2020, now supports a network of eight community groups across the country - all opposed to outdoor corporate advertising.
These include Adblock Bristol, which claims to have successfully campaigned against a number of proposed outdoor advertising sites being given planning permission in the city.
Unsurprisingly, the outdoor advertising industry, which calls its sector Out of Home (OOH), strongly defends itself.
Tim Lumb, from the trade body Outsmart, points out that adverts ""contribute a significant amount of money every year to the transport authorities and local councils through rent and business rates"".
He adds: ""In a free society businesses have the right to advertise their wares, and individual citizens are not the helpless, brainless automatons that Adfree Cities considers them to be.
""Individuals make free and informed decisions about their spending choices, and pursue whatever they consider to be their 'good life', safe in the knowledge that advertising in the UK, including OOH, is appropriately regulated to ensure it is legal, decent, honest and truthful.""
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for another trade organisation, the Advertising Association, says that ""all advertising plays a crucial role in brand competition, drives product innovation, and fuels economic growth"".
Yet some anti-advertising groups have been resorting to direct action, such as covering over billboards and other outdoor adverts. These include some membership groups of Adfree Cities, including Adblock Lambeth in London and Adblock Norwich.
Brandalism, a collective of activists, is another such organisation. It particularly targets adverts promoting cars, airlines and energy firms, such as putting up fake billboard posters of cars stuck in traffic jams, or altering legitimate posters to call for the banning of fossil fuels.
""We want to question the legitimacy of corporate outdoor adverting and draw attention to the impact they can have on social issues, mental health, wellbeing, the climate, and the communication of public space,"" says Brandalism's Tona Merriman, who is using a pseudonym.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
""There's a growing popularity of people using the tactic of ad hacking, and altering commercial ads posters, or putting satirical ads over them. We see [what we do] as a right of reply to corporate messaging. If they are allowed to get the message out, the public has a right to reply to those ads.""
Mr Lumb says that Brandalism's approach is ""essentially vandalism and illegal, not to mention a public safety issue. And the reposting and occasional repair costs of Brandalism run into thousands of pounds each year.""
Still, some experts say that banning certain outdoor adverts may be a good idea, such as Dr Nathan Critchlow, research fellow at Institute for Social Marketing and Health at the University of Stirling.
""There is consistent evidence that exposure to marketing for unhealthy commodities - for example advertising for alcohol or food and drinks high in fat, salt, or sugar - is associated with consumption, including among children and young people,"" he says.
He points to the impact of Transport for London's ban on such adverts since 2019 across its entire network of tube and overground trains, buses and trams. A study last month found that the policy had prevented almost 100,000 obesity cases.
Ms Gage says that instead of big adverts, ""we'd rather see community arts, murals, local projects, and renewed green spaces"".",Suzanne Bearne,Business reporter,"Campaigner Charlotte Gage says that the outdoor adverts you see on billboards and bus stops should all be removed. She is the network director of UK pressure group Adfree Cities.

2022-09-05T23:04:04.000Z,How India is building a pearl farming industry,"In 2016 Narendra Garwa was facing a desperate financial situation. His small book store in the village of Renwal, Rajasthan, was running at a loss.
With a family to support and little education, he searched the internet for other money-making ideas. He had some success growing vegetables in plastic bottles, but then came across a potentially more profitable crop - pearls.
""Rajasthan is a dry area with water issues. It was a challenge to think of growing pearls with limited water but I decided to try,"" he says.
Pearls are formed when a mollusc reacts to an irritant in its protective membrane. The mollusc deposits layers of aragonite and conchiolin, which together form nacre, also know as mother-of-pearl.
In the wild, pearl formation is rare so most pearls sold these days are from farmed molluscs, usually oysters or freshwater mussels.
To spur the mollusc to form a pearl, an irritant is artificially introduced into the creature. However, it is a delicate process and the mussels or oysters must be carefully handled, as Mr Garwa found.
""My first attempt was a disaster,"" he admits. Of the 500 mussels he purchased, only 35 survived.
Mr Garwa had travelled to Kerala to buy the mussels - a journey of 1,700 miles involving a 36-hour train journey. He also used his savings and borrowed money to come up with the 16,000 rupees (¬£170; $200) needed to buy the molluscs.
In addition, Mr Garwa had dug a 10ft by 10ft pound in his back garden to keep the creatures in.
Despite the setback, he did not give up. Instead, he took a five-day course in pearl farming.
""Growing an oyster is like bringing up a baby,"" he says.
""Monitoring the the water throughout the growth period is crucial to achieving high quality and volume of produce.""
Now he has a 40ft by 50ft pond, which he treats with multivitamins and alum which maintains the correct pH level required for growth.
The survival rate of his mussels has risen from 30% to more than 70% since becoming more familiar with the process. Mr Garwa expects to produce around 3,000 pearls this year, which he can sell for between 400 and 900 rupees (¬£4-¬£10; $5-$11).
The Indian government has been encouraging pearl fishing as part of its Blue Revolution, a plan to modernise the nation's fishing industry.
Under the scheme the government pays for half the cost of setting up a pond for pearl fishing, and so far the Department for Fisheries has given financial support to 232 pearl farming ponds.
""Pearl farming is one of the most lucrative aquaculture businesses and the government is encouraging farmers to take up this farming,"" says Jujjavarapu Balaji, Joint Secretary of Marine Fisheries.
Not everyone is impressed with this wave of pearl farming activity. Critics include Gunjan Shah, who is the fifth generation of his family to be in the pearl trading business.
""The culture of pearl farming has increased in India but I think the pearls grown in every nook and corner are not of very good quality"" says the owner of Babla Enterprises, based in Mumbai.
More technology of business:
He says India is producing too many of the wrong kind of pearls.
""What India needs at present is people who can grow sea water pearls if we want to compete with China. Indian oysters are small but China has hybrid oysters which produce large pearls.
""Cultured South Sea pearls are the most valuable type of cultured pearl on the market today. These pearls come in a gorgeous variety of sizes, shapes and colours. A strand of South Sea pearls can be as expensive as $10,000 (¬£8,500) or more. They are very rarely produced in India.""
He says the government should be looking to develop this part of the industry.
In its defence, the government says it will take time to build up a competitive pearl farming sector.
""Pearl family is specialised farming, so this sector will take time to grow. The plan is to see the increase in the next three years,"" says Mr Balaji, from the Department for Fisheries.
""Once we are able to grow enough pearls for local consumption then we can focus on exports,"" he adds.
As for Mr Garwa, as well as farming pearls, he also offers courses for those who want to learn how to do it.
Reena Choudary, 28, was one of his students, and just like her tutor her first effort last year was a failure.
""I lost all the oysters - none of them were able to produce,"" she says.
But this year, she expects to produce around 1,000 pearls.
Starting an independent business was a big leap for her, particularly as women in her region are often expected to look after the home rather than work.
""For people like us this smells like freedom,"" she says. ""We have learnt how we can be independent, help towards contributing to the family and have a say in family matters.""",Priti Gupta,Mumbai,"Pearls are formed when a mollusc reacts to an irritant in its protective membrane.

2022-09-16T21:04:44.000Z,US abortion bans leave grey areas in complicated pregnancies,"Moments after unveiling a bill that would ban all abortions in the United States at 15 weeks, US Senator Lindsey Graham was interrupted by a mother with a devastating story.
""I did everything right and at 16 weeks we found out that our son would likely not live,"" Ashbey Beasley told a crowded room. ""When he was born, for eight days he bled from every orifice of his body,"" she said.
But, she said, at least she got to choose how to handle her difficult pregnancy, while Mr Graham's law would take away that choice.
""What do you say to someone like me?""
Mr Graham is not the only lawmaker who has been asked tough questions about his abortion stance, and how it might affect women with complicated or dangerous pregnancies.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade this summer, states across the US have pushed through abortion bans or severely restricted the procedure. But as such laws have gone into effect, unintended consequences have followed.
Doctors and patients say that confusing standards and the vague language of these laws have had a chilling effect on the medical field in anti-abortion states, leaving tragedies in their wake - and more in the making.
Abortions for medical reasons are rare, constituting less than 4% of all such procedures in the US in 2004, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
But for certain pregnancy complications, they are an accepted and not uncommon procedure to save lives.
The model Chrissy Teigen, for example, said on Friday an abortion was used to save her life when she was 20 weeks along with a pregnancy that was unviable.
But today, in states with strict abortion limits, that option is becoming increasingly complicated.
For the last year, Amanda Horton, a Texas doctor who specialises in high-risk pregnancies, has struggled to care for patients with pregnancy complications.
At times, Dr Horton must inform families that their babies have been diagnosed with a fatal foetal anomaly. These conditions are rare and likely to lead to the death of a foetus in utero, or shortly after birth.
But under a strict abortion ban in Texas, her hands are tied.
""We can say, 'If you're interested in pregnancy termination, that's always an option. But it's not an option for you in Texas. And that's really where the counselling begins and ends,"" she said.
""These are people who love their unborn baby, and who, through no fault of their own, have been challenged in ways that they never expected,"" she said. But because her state bans all abortions except in life-threatening circumstances, ""now, the answer is, 'We can't help you, good luck.'""
Texas has one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans. But like all such bans passed this year, the state allows an exception when a pregnancy is a threat to the mother's life.
Indeed, all states that ban abortion include similar exceptions when the life of a mother is threatened.
About a dozen states' laws include language allowing abortions in cases of a ""medical emergency"", and three specifically include an exception for foetal anomalies. West Virginia, which just passed an abortion ban this week, outlaws the procedure ""except in a medical emergency or a non-medically viable foetus"".
Mr Graham's proposal for a national law would come with broadly worded exemptions for a woman whose ""life is endangered"".
However, critics say that in practice these laws give little guidance on broad terms like ""life-threatening"", or what constitutes a medical emergency that would permit an abortion.
That leaves ample room for debate over when a doctor should act, and in some cases, has even altered options that would have been considered a standard of care.
In July, a Texas woman identified only as Amanda, told the New York Times that she spent 48 hours in agony, sitting in a bathtub while the water turned ""dark red"" as she waited for her body to expel the pregnancy after suffering a miscarriage.
Previously, when she had a miscarriage, doctors had performed a dilation and curettage (also known as a ""D & C"") procedure, in which tissue is removed from the uterus. But at the time of her second miscarriage, Texas had implemented a ban allowing private citizens to sue anyone who helps perform an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.
Amanda was not given the procedure.
""It was so different from my first experience where they were so nice and so comforting, to now just feeling alone and terrified,"" she said.
Such cases have highlighted the gap between written policies over abortion limits and the medical reality, and it has doctors worried.
""It's very dangerous when legislators who have no experience in the area of medicine are legislating about how we can practise medicine, and prohibiting us from providing the standard of care,"" said Daniel Grossman, an obstetrician at the University of California in San Francisco.
Many of the bans are modelled after draft legislation proposed by the National Right to Life (NRL), the nation's oldest anti-abortion organisation. Their model legislation allows for abortions when the mother's life is threatened.
""Our model law language says, 'reasonable medical judgement' of the attending physician, which is the usual case in all medical situations, not just abortions,"" NRL told BBC News in a statement.
""We're not aware of any pro-life legislation, including our model law, that would prevent appropriate medical treatment in any of these cases.""
But for people facing difficult pregnancies, these laws, in practice, can get in the way of medical care.
In Louisiana, the story of Nancy Davis made national headlines after she said doctors would not terminate her non-viable pregnancy. At a press conference, Ms Davis told reporters her baby had acrania, a condition that causes a foetus to develop without a skull and is incompatible with life.
""Basically, they said I had to carry my baby, to bury my baby,"" she said, adding doctors ""seemed confused about the law and afraid of what would happen to them if they performed a 'criminal abortion' according to the law.""
""I want you to imagine what it's been like to continue this pregnancy for another six weeks after this diagnosis,"" she said. ""This is not fair to me, and it should not happen to any other woman.""
In South Carolina, a Republican state senator, Neal Collins, went viral for confessing he regretted voting for a six-week abortion ban, after a local OB-GYN told him the story of a 19-year-old who faced a harrowing miscarriage but was denied care.
""That whole week, I did not sleep,"" Mr Collins said in a speech before the state's judiciary committee. He said he followed up and, two weeks later, the ER was able to ""extract"" the foetus, but only after it had died.
Days after expressing his regret, Mr Collins voted in favour of a near-total abortion ban that includes a list of some dozen situations that qualify as exceptions.
And last month, after Ms Davis miscarried, Louisiana's health department issued a list of conditions that would render a pregnancy ""medically futile"" and qualify for an exception to the state's near-total abortion ban.
But Dr Grossman says it's impossible to make a list of the conditions that meet the ""medical emergency"" exception.
""It doesn't work that way. In medicine there's a lot of grey areas and uncertainty,"" he said. ""If there's a 20% risk of death in the next month if they continue the pregnancy, that's a tremendously high risk. It would be the standard of care to offer that patient termination.""",Chelsea Bailey & Kayla Epstein,"BBC News, Washington","Abortions for medical reasons are rare, constituting less than 4% of all such procedures in the US in 2004.

2022-09-16T16:19:42.000Z,Bill Turnbull: Tributes paid to broadcaster at funeral,"Friends and colleagues of former BBC broadcaster Bill Turnbull have paid tribute to him at his funeral service.
Turnbull, who hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, died on 31 August, aged 66.
His funeral service was held at the Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh in Suffolk, where he had lived.
His BBC Breakfast co-host Sian Williams said he was ""an extraordinary man"".
Other broadcasters, including Charlie Stayt, Susanna Reid and Naga Munchetty, were among those at the service.
Turnbull's two sons and son-in-law were among the six pallbearers carrying his oak coffin, adorned with a red rose and purple bouquet, into the church.
Other famous names who attended included Martha Kearney, Mike Bushell, Louise Minchin, Charlotte Hawkins and Nick Robinson.
Williams, his friend of 30 years and BBC Breakfast co-host for more than a decade, said: ""Bill was an extraordinary man and I don't think he quite ever realised the impact he had on other people.
""I met somebody just yesterday at the hospital where I work - he was a porter and he said 'I went to get checked [for prostate cancer] because Bill told me to' and that impact has been felt throughout the UK.
""He was a mate, he was a very loyal friend, and he was great to sit next to for 11 years. We trusted one another and respected one another... I'll remember him with a smile, he made me laugh.""
Turnbull hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and also fronted Songs of Praise and game show Think Tank.
After leaving the BBC in 2016, he joined Classic FM and continued presenting shows on the network until recently.
A signed Wycombe Wanderers shirt with the number 60 had been placed on a bench outside the church to mark Turnbull's support for the football club.
Current BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty, who shared the red sofa with Turnbull for several years, said: ""He was passionate about the job and passionate about the journalism and passionate about the audience.
""The audience was all that mattered, and all that does matter, and Bill never forgot that - he was a joy to sit beside.""
She added that she would remember Turnbull as a ""funny, charming, cheeky guy"".
Williams added: ""I wish he were able to understand how much he was valued, and I think it is incredible the number of people here who just wanted to come and celebrate and pay their respects to him.
""I think the reason that so many people have turned out today to pay their respects - to think about him and share memories of him and to celebrate him - is because he was a good man.""
Robinson, presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, said he was ""going to miss him terribly"".
""People sometimes say people who present TV shows get paid a vast amount of money, they get a lot of praise and it's easy. And it is easy, but the funny thing is hardly anybody can do it well,"" he said.
""Bill Turnbull did it brilliantly because he was a seriously good journalist, but he also was a human being who could reach out, empathise and be warm with people, from presidents, kings and queens down to people talking about their pets.""
David Kogan, one of Turnbull's former editors, said he was ""as close to me as a brother could be"".
""As a friend he was a very funny companion with whom I went on long trips, we listened to music, we went to football, he was a man who had great depth of personality and character, great depth of friendship and family. He was a great guy,"" he said.
""I've witnessed Bill for the last five years fighting this illness with incredible strength of will, and his family also fighting it with their incredible levels of support, and in the last few weeks of his life, when the battle was clearly being lost, he was a man who was not going to give up life easily.
""It was a tragic moment when we lost him; we lost him far too young; it is a very emotional day and we will miss him.""

2022-09-16T02:19:07.000Z,Michael Jordan's 'Last Dance' jersey fetches record $10.1m,"A jersey worn by basketball icon Michael Jordan during the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals has been sold for a record $10.1m (¬£8.8m).
It is the most a piece of sporting memorabilia worn during play has fetched in history.
Auction house Sotheby's says it drew ""palpable excitement"" from collectors.
It was reminiscent of a sporting season - chronicled in Netflix documentary The Last Dance - which saw Jordan winning his sixth and final NBA title.
On Thursday, Sotheby's said Jordan's Chicago Bulls jersey attracted a total of 20 bids.
Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectables, Brahm Wachter, said bidders were ""eager to own a rarefied piece of history"".
""Today's record-breaking result... solidifies Michael Jordan as the undisputed G.O.A.T, proving his name and incomparable legacy is just as relevant as it was nearly 25 years ago,"" Wachter said. G.O.A.T is an acronym for ""greatest of all time"".
The jersey outstripped a previous record of $9.28m, paid for a shirt worn by football star Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup.
It was auctioned with a June 1998 Sports Illustrated magazine, which features Jordan on the cover.
Jordan is seen by many as the best player in the history of basketball. He spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls, became a global icon and helped raise the NBA's profile around the world.
Although the Chicago Bulls lost the opening game of the NBA Finals against Utah Jazz, it won the next three games. Then Utah Jazz took the next game by two points.
In the sixth game, Jordan put the Bulls up 87-86 with just 5.2 seconds left on the clock, and secured his final NBA title.
The comeback was cheered by basketball fans around the world.
Jordan had abruptly retired from basketball in October 1993, following the murder of his father in North Carolina. The star had won seven scoring titles and led the Chicago Bulls to three straight championships.
""I have always stressed... that when I lose the sense of motivation and the sense to prove something as a basketball player, it's time to leave,"" Jordan said.

2022-09-13T14:33:33.000Z,Syria cholera outbreak serious threat to region - UN,"The UN has expressed concern about the first confirmed cholera outbreak in Syria in years, saying it poses a ""serious threat"" to the entire region.
More than 900 suspected cases and eight deaths have been reported in the war-torn country in the past three weeks.
The outbreak has been concentrated in Aleppo and Deir al-Zour provinces.
It is believed to be linked to people drinking contaminated water from the River Euphrates, which flows through the provinces, and using it on crops.
The outbreak is also seen as an indicator of the severe shortages of water throughout Syria caused by climate change and conflict.
Rising temperatures, below-average rainfall and reduced flow from upstream neighbour Turkey have resulted in critically low levels in the Euphrates.
That, combined with widespread damage to supply and sewerage infrastructure, has left many of the 5 million Syrians who depend on the river for drinking water and crop irrigation reliant on unsafe sources. It has also triggered an increase in dangerous water-borne diseases like cholera.
The Syrian health ministry said on Monday that 20 cases of cholera, including two deaths, had been confirmed by laboratories in the northern province of Aleppo, the state-run Sana news agency reported.
It added that another four cases had been confirmed in the coastal province of Latakia as well as two in the capital Damascus among patients from Aleppo.
However, the UN warned that surveillance data showed a total of 936 severe acute diarrhoea cases, including at least eight related deaths, had been recorded across Syria since 25 August.
More than 670 of those suspected cases and six of the deaths were in Aleppo, while 201 cases and two deaths were in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour.
""The outbreak presents a serious threat to people in Syria and the region,"" warned the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator in Syria, Imran Riza.
""Swift and urgent action is needed to prevent further illness and death,"" he added, appealing to donor countries for urgent additional funding.
The UN said rapid diagnostic tests, intravenous fluids and rehydration salts had been delivered to health facilities in affected communities and other high-risk areas, such as camps for displaced people. Clean water is also being delivered by lorries and chlorination is being scaled up.

2022-09-16T23:16:48.000Z,"China, Europe, US drought: Is 2022 the driest year recorded?","Europe and parts of China have experienced extreme temperatures this summer, dry conditions in Africa have put millions at risk of starvation, and the American West continues to see a persistent lack of rainfall.
Scientists say warmer and drier seasons are likely to become the norm, but have these past few months been the driest on record?
One measure of drought conditions used by scientists is based on the level of moisture in the soil as measured by satellite imagery.
We have compared these dry conditions over the past three months to average conditions since the beginning of this century, to build up a picture of how extreme recent weather patterns have been.
This data is based on both soil conditions and temperature data to create what is known as a soil moisture anomaly map.
We can see that most of Europe has experienced much drier weather this summer than the average for the period 2001 to 2016.
Elsewhere, the west of China has been very dry, with many areas experiencing extreme drought. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa and the US are also experiencing critically dry conditions.
In Europe, this summer's drought may be the worst the continent has experienced in 500 years, according to the EU's environmental programme Copernicus.
At the peak of the dry spell in late August, almost half of Europe suffered from a ""soil moisture deficit"".
Scientists say climate change means Europe will continue to experience more frequent and persistent droughts, and the dry conditions this year have affected agriculture, transport and energy generation.
The Rhine, a major river and cargo route, dropped to critically low levels this summer, causing shipping disruption.
The period between June and August was the hottest on record, and a report by the EU in August predicted at least three more months of ""warmer and drier"" days.
Europe has experienced droughts in the past, but recent years have seen increasingly hot summers with many high temperature records set.
""We have now had consecutive droughts for the last five years, and this year is the worst Europe-wide drought in hundreds of years,"" says Dr Fred Hattermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
""It's not just less rain, it's also that it's got much warmer, so the overall soil moisture has decreased.""
This summer, China experienced an extended period of high temperatures that lasted more than two months, the longest since records began in the 1960s, according to China's Meteorological Administration.
Extreme heat and a severe lack of rainfall meant China's biggest river, the Yangtze, shrank. During August, there was 60% less rainfall in the river's drainage area than normal, according to official Chinese data.
Despite large areas in southern China struggling with drought, heavy rains in northern areas led to flooding. The Liao River in northern China recorded its second highest water level since 1961.
And nationwide, rainfall has steadily increased since 2012, China's annual climate change study says.
In July, the Chinese government issued eight drought warnings and more than 13,000 heavy rain warnings. In 2019, there were more than 28 drought warnings and 10,000 heavy rain warnings for the same period.
Seeing both extreme wet and dry conditions is a feature of climate change across the globe.
""When areas of drought grow, like in Siberia and western US, that water falls elsewhere in a smaller area, worsening flooding,"" Peter Gleick, a water specialist from the US National Academy of Sciences, says.
Drought conditions in eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and Somalia have led the UN to warn that some 22 million people could be at risk of starvation.
""We are now in the third year of very low rainfall coupled with high temperatures in that part of the continent,"" according to Oxfam.
In Somalia, the rainfall in the March to May season was the lowest in the last six decades. And large parts of DR Congo and Uganda have also experienced very dry conditions compared with the average.
But measurements of soil moisture also show how in some countries, such as South Sudan, Mauritania and Senegal, there has been severe flooding.
Many parts of southern Africa have also experienced much higher than normal levels of rainfall.
A World Bank report in 2021 noted that overall ""relative to 1970-79, the numbers of droughts and floods were nearly threefold and tenfold respectively, by 2010-19"".
Drought conditions in the western US have become the norm, with the region experiencing years of drier and hotter weather.
In a report published in February, scientists said the last two decades had seen the most extreme drought conditions in 1,200 years in the American west.
And this summer, hot and dry weather led to forest fires in several states and water storage levels dropping.
Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir in the US which straddles Arizona and Utah, is at its lowest level since it was filled in the 1960s, according to Nasa.
Climate models predict that the region will continue to have far less rainfall than average in the coming decades.

2022-09-16T09:01:47.000Z,Cardi B: Rapper pleads guilty to strip club assault charges,"Cardi B has admitted two offences arising from a brawl in a strip club, as part of a deal that means she will avoid a trial and possible jail time.
The Grammy-winning rapper, born Belcalis Almanzar, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and second-degree reckless endangerment, and was sentenced to 15 days community service.
Ten other charges were dismissed.
""I've made some bad decisions in my past that I am not afraid to face and own up to,"" she said in a statement.
In court, the 29-year-old admitted organising and participating in two attacks on employees of the Angels nightclub in New York in 2018.
According to authorities, the incidents grew out of a feud between Almanzar and two sisters - one of whom she believed was having an affair with her husband, the rapper Offset.
Prosecutors said that, on the first night, Almanzar and her entourage struck the victim, a bartender, pulling her hair, punching her and slamming her head into the bar.
Two weeks later, they returned, throwing alcohol, bottles and a hookah pipe at the first victim's sister.
Asked to confirm the details in court, Almanzar did so quietly, admitting she had offered a friend $5,000 (¬£4,000) over Instagram to assist her in the confrontation.
As well as community service, the rapper has been ordered to stay away from the victims, identified as Jade and Baddie Gi, for three years.
She accepted the plea deal one day before the case was due to come to trial, the New York Times reported.
The musician's lawyer, Drew Findling, said she wanted to draw a line under the case.
""There are too many things that she has planned for her family, for her career and for the community and she just felt, quite honestly, that a three-week jury trial was going to be a distraction from the things that she felt was most important and so, hence, we made contact with the prosecution,"" he told the New York Post.
In her statement, the rapper said: ""Part of growing up and maturing is being accountable for your actions. As a mother, it's a practice that I am trying to instil in my children, but the example starts with me.
""These moments don't define me and they are not reflective of who I am now.""
Melinda Katz, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement: ""No-one is above the law. In pleading guilty today, Ms Belcalis Almanzar and two co-defendants have accepted responsibility for their actions.""
Cardi B rose to fame with the track Bodak Yellow in 2017, topping the Billboard chart and becoming one of rap's most colourful and outspoken performers.
Her debut album, Invasion of Privacy, won the Grammy for best rap album in 2019, and she has scored global number one hits with the Latin-flavoured I Like It and the X-rated WAP, a duet with Megan Thee Stallion.
After Thursday's hearing at Queens County Criminal Court in New York, she was mobbed by dozens of fans and court employees.
""In all my years of covering court cases, I've never seen this,"" said NBC news reporter Melissa Colorado on Twitter. ""Court staff cheering for a defendant who accepted a plea deal as she walks out of the court room.""

2022-09-04T23:02:57.000Z,Japan's female bosses mapping a course for other women,"Believed to have started in 869AD, the Gion Matsuri is one of the most famous annual festivals in Japan. This year it embraced the digital world.
For the 2022 event back in July, an interactive, online map was made available to show where and when to see the 34 huge, ornate floats that paraded across the city of Kyoto over two separate days.
Using GPS, it showed the location of each float. And you could also use the map to find your friends and chat with them. In addition, if you clicked on a building or street, you could read about its history in Japanese or English.
The person behind the technology is Machi Takahashi, the president and co-chief executive of Kyoto-based, digital map firm Stroly. A mother of two, she is a rare female entrepreneur in a country where the start-up scene is still very much dominated by men.
""I was surprised that [the festival organisers] would let us digitise their map, because I thought these traditional cultural festivals are quite conservative,"" she says.
The website-based digital map is accessed by scanning a QR code. Hideo Yoshii, who is in charge of looking after one of the biggest floats, says that Stroly may have gotten some pushback if it had just wanted to put QR code stickers or signs up on walls.
Instead Stroly created a pretty postcard that had not just the QR code printed on it, but also the pattern of a traditional Japanese map. This complemented the atmosphere of the ancient event, and was also used as the design for the digital map Stroly made.
""Before the pandemic, we gave out a pamphlet, but tourists found it difficult to navigate the city,"" says a spokeswoman for the city's tourism department.
""By using Stroly's digital map, police officers who are on the ground found it much easier to explain to visitors where to go. We've also managed to reduce our paper waste by a third,"" she adds.
The idea to set up a business making digital maps came to Ms Takahashi and her husband and co-founder Toru while they were both still working at Kyoto-based technology research institute ATR. He is Stroly's chairman and co-chief executive.
One of their first customers was the movie industry theme park Toei Kyoto Studio Park back in 2010.
""We asked Mr and Ms Takahashi to create a game using Nintendo DS,"" says Norihiro Yamaguchi, who was the boss of Toei Kyoto Studio Park at the time.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
The map and GPS-based game that the Takahashis produced involved the park's visitors having to locate seven actors playing screen villains.
Six years later, the Takahashis left the research institute to set up Stroly as their own business, with the theme park remaining one of its main clients.
""Thanks to smartphones which allow users to access the Stroly map in different languages, visitors can find out about the details of our shows and facilities,"" says a spokesman for the park.
Stroly has now produced almost 10,000 interactive, digital maps, including one highlighting the vibrant nightlife of the busy Shinjuku area of central Tokyo. That was commissioned by the government of the capital city.
Other maps include where to find the best cheese in the Tokachi dairy farming region of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, as well as work for clients outside Japan.
For members of the public Stroly's maps are free to use. It instead makes its money by charging its customers, mostly in tourism and transport, annual subscriptions.
""When I started thinking about starting my own business in 2015, there was no woman in this information technology field so I had to find my way into this community,"" says Ms Takahashi.
""I had to actually contact [US-based Japanese entrepreneur] Ari Horie from Women's Startup Lab in Silicon Valley, instead of [anyone] in Japan, to help me out.""
Stroly was subsequently selected as one of the first start-ups to be given mentoring by a new regional business support agency called Osaka Innovation Hub.
This was where Ms Takahashi managed to secure funding from Japanese investment bank Daiwa Securities. The firm also later received money from Kyoto City's start-up fund.
The difficulty faced by female entrepreneurs is not unique to Japan. Even in the US, only 2% of venture capital, which invests in new start-ups, went to women last year.
In an article for Vogue magazine last month where she announced that she was ""evolving away from tennis"", US sports star Serena Williams said this was part of the reason she launched her own investment fund, Serena Ventures.
""Sometimes like attracts like,"" wrote Williams. ""Men are writing those big cheques to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves.""
Ms Takahashi agrees. ""The decision-making roles are also mostly [held by] men. I think they simply cannot relate to the problems and issues addressed by women entrepreneurs,"" she says.
The Japanese government had wanted to use the five years from 2015 to 2020 to almost triple the proportion of female managers in the country to reach 30% of the total. However, the current level is just 15%, compared with the global average of 31%.
And according to the country's Financial Services Agency, less than 1% of Japanese venture capital firms are run by women.
Kathy Matsui leads one such firm, MPower Partners, which she recently started in Tokyo with two female partners, Yumiko Murakami and Seki Miwa. A former vice chair of investment bank Goldman Sachs Japan, Ms Matsui is best known for her ""womenomics"" drive since the 1990s, which has encouraged the Japanese government to improve its gender ratio among businesses.
""I would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs and founders we've met so far, here in Japan, are male,"" she says.
""But when we think about start-ups, they're trying to use innovation to create disruptive businesses, life-changing technologies. And if you're excluding half the population from your potential talent pool as a start-up, you're already trying to win a marathon on one leg rather than two.""
Back in Kyoto, Ms Takahashi's success in finding a gap in the digital tourism market may be an exception to the male-dominated rule. There is no denying that it is still an uphill battle to create a greater equal footing in Japan's workforce.
So does she have any advice for younger entrepreneurs, and particularly female ones?
""Jump into the ecosystem,"" she says. ""It is very easy to get to know someone in the field, and once you know somebody, it's a great network that you need to expand your business.""

2022-09-01T23:02:41.000Z,The inside scoop on ice cream innovation,"In the summer heat, few things are more satisfying than a cooling ice cream. But did you ever wonder what it takes to make the scoop on your cone?
This traditional treat dates back centuries, but today many frozen desserts are the culmination of months of research and development.
On the outskirts of the Danish city Aarhus is what might be considered ice cream's answer to Silicon Valley.
Among a cluster of businesses, including dairy producers, engineers and service providers, is a manufacturing plant owned by food packaging giant Tetra Pak.
This place is also home to a product development centre where future recipes and technology are tested out.
""It's the first step in a long journey to having a product launched,"" says Elsebeth Baungaard, portfolio manager at Tetra Pak.
""We're testing what we will see on the market next summer or two years from now.""
Inside the bright laboratory are steel vats, freezers and a machine turning out oval-shaped ice creams onto a conveyor belt.
Tetra Pak's clients - the world's major ice cream brands - often spend two or three days in the facility making and tasting samples.
""We see how the mouthfeel is, the texture, and if it's working,"" she explains.
There are also a variety of experts at hand to help out with the process along the way, including specialist ""stick inserters"".
The facility allows customers to try new recipes without tying up their own production. New products are released in late spring, then manufacturing ramps up ready for summer.
""There's a lot of investment in innovation during the winter,"" says Tetra Pak's Ice Cream Academy manager Torben Vilsgaard.
The US and China are the biggest consumers, and according to Tetra Pak, more than 25 billion litres were eaten worldwide in 2021.
Meanwhile in the UK, sizzling summer temperatures have sent ice cream sales soaring. Data from NielsenIQ shows purchases were 28% higher in the four weeks to mid-August, compared a year earlier.
But just how is this delicious treat made?
Production starts with the mix. Milk or water is combined with dry ingredients such as milk solids, sugars and dairy or vegetable fats. The liquid is heated and homogenised, then cooled and ""aged"".
Dressed in a white lab coat, Mr Vilsgaard walks me through the process. ""We add functional ingredients like flavours and colours, but also stabilisers and the emulsifier.
""They give some viscosity. That is the mouthfeel, when it's consumed and melting down.""
Next it's pumped to a continuous freezer. ""This is the heart of any ice cream production facility,"" he says.
This ""small"" unit can make 700 litres an hour, but commercial-scale freezers can produce up to 4,000.
Inside a rotating cylinder the mix is rapidly cooled and beaten, while incorporating air. The ice cream emerges slightly soft, so it can be pumped into a tub or mould, then stored at a lower temperature.
While the recipe sounds simple, ice cream has a complex chemistry consisting of ice crystals, air bubbles and fat globules, held in a water and sugar solution.
""It's one of the few products that holds all three states at once. It's solid, liquid and gas, all in one,"" says Dr Chika Nweke, a fellow in biochemical engineering, who teaches ice cream manufacturing at University College London.
""Normally liquids and oils don't mix very well. But with the addition of the emulsifier you get the fats in the ice cream sticking together with the liquids,"" she says.
Getting the balance right is a precise science and it's important for the ice cream's stability.
Recipes have really evolved, says Dr Nweke, and there is a lot of research going into new ingredients, particularly alternatives to lactose or sugars.
However, there are also some rather more unexpected components.
""Up to 50% of it can be air,"" says Dr Nweke, revealing that it's crucial to making the ice cream ""scoop-able"".
More technology of business:
Commercial production is increasingly automated and at Tetra Pak engineers are tinkering with a new factory line capable of making a million ice creams a day.
The firm estimates that half of the world's ice cream output is made using its equipment.
Recently it supplied one of the first collaborative robots, known as a cobot, where staff work alongside it filling ice cream bowls.
Designers are also developing special nozzles to make complex shapes like animals, or multiple layers of different flavours, and moulds are 3D printed.
However, keeping ice cream cold is energy-intensive. Elsebeth Baungaard says she and her colleagues are working on a more targeted cooling process that chills specific spots.
Other firms have developed technology that is quite literally ""out of the box"".
For example, US firm Cold Snap makes ice cream pods that are only frozen in an appliance when you want to eat it, thereby eliminating the energy consumed by storing it in a freezer.
Back in the lab at Tetra Pak, where future ice creams are tested, I'm keen to get the inside scoop on what's coming next.
""I'm sorry to say it's simply shrinking. We are downsizing the volume,"" Ms Baungaard replies. ""Small cones, small sticks, the bite-size. But the quality will be higher.""
That's a global trend that Kate Vlietstra, a food and drink analyst from Mintel, also recognises, together with a shift towards more ""indulgent"" flavours over healthier, low-calorie choices.
""People go for affordable treats,"" she says. The firm's research found that 48% of UK consumers think it has been ""easier to justify eating indulgent food or drink since Covid-19"".
Ms Vlietstra thinks concerns about the cost-of-living crisis will have a similar impact. ""Ice cream is obviously very affordable, even a premium ice cream, and can offer a great experience at home.""
But while both younger and older consumers buy ice cream regularly, she says it is millennial consumers who are driving interest in more original flavours, including spices like chilli or cardamom.
Dairy still dominates, but plant-based ice cream and sorbets are another growing segment. Other new innovations may soon find their way into our freezers.
Behind Ms Baungaard is a machine with a wheel that can embed chunks of cookie dough or brownie, known as inclusions, into ice creams on a stick.
""That's new,"" she says. ""We are the only one on the market who can do it."" (It is already done in cups.)
Another new technique is decorating stick products with patterns or writing. As ice cream samples pass by, you have to wonder if this line of work might be potentially hazardous for dessert lovers.
""It is absolute temptation,"" Ms Baungaard says. ""But you also get used to it.""",Adrienne Murray,"Technology of Business reporter, Aarhus","Tetra Pak's Ice Cream Academy allows customers to try new recipes without tying up their own production.
